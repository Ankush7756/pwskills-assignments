    "Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception. Note: Here Exception class refers to the base class for all the exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: In Python, all built-in exceptions are derived from the BaseException class, which is further derived from the object class. The Exception class is a standard Python class that inherits from BaseException. When creating a custom exception, it is recommended to inherit from the Exception class to maintain compatibility with the existing exception hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "By inheriting from the Exception class, custom exceptions can benefit from the standard exception-handling mechanisms provided by Python. This includes being caught by a generic except block that catches all exceptions (except Exception as e). It also ensures that the custom exception can be handled in the same way as other built-in exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    raise CustomError(\"This is a custom exception.\")\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Caught an exception: {e}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Write a Python program to print Python Exception Hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "def print_exception_hierarchy(exception_class, indent=0):\n",
    "    print(\"  \" * indent + f\"{exception_class.__name__}\")\n",
    "    for subclass in exception_class.__subclasses__():\n",
    "        print_exception_hierarchy(subclass, indent + 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "print_exception_hierarchy(BaseException)\n",
    "This program defines a function print_exception_hierarchy that recursively prints the hierarchy of exception classes starting from BaseException. It uses the __subclasses__ method to get the direct subclasses of a class. Running this program will print the entire exception hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What errors are defined in the ArithmeticError class? Explain any two with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The ArithmeticError class in Python is the base class for numeric errors that may occur during arithmetic operations. Two errors defined in this class are:\n",
    "\n",
    "OverflowError: Raised when an arithmetic operation exceeds the limits of the data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "result = 10 ** 1000  # Raises OverflowError for exceeding the limit of the data type\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: Raised when division or modulo by zero occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "result = 5 / 0  # Raises ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "Q4. Why is the LookupError class used? Explain with an example KeyError and IndexError.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The LookupError class is the base class for errors that occur when a key or index is not found. Two errors derived from LookupError are:\n",
    "\n",
    "KeyError: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}\n",
    "value = my_dict['city']  # Raises KeyError as 'city' is not a key in the dictionary\n",
    "IndexError: Raised when trying to access an index that is out of range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "value = my_list[5]  # Raises IndexError as the index 5 is out of range\n",
    "Q5. Explain ImportError. What is ModuleNotFoundError?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: ImportError is raised when an import statement fails to find the specified module. ModuleNotFoundError is a subclass of ImportError and is more specific. It is raised when a specified module cannot be found during the import process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    import non_existent_module  # Raises ModuleNotFoundError\n",
    "except ImportError as ie:\n",
    "    print(f\"Import error: {ie}\")\n",
    "except ModuleNotFoundError as mne:\n",
    "    print(f\"Module not found error: {mne}\")\n",
    "Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Practices for Exception Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific Exception Handling: Catch specific exceptions rather than using a generic except block. This helps in better understanding and handling of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid Bare except: Avoid using a bare except clause as it catches all exceptions and makes it difficult to identify and debug issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use finally for Cleanup: Use the finally block for cleanup operations that must be performed whether an exception occurs or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep Try Blocks Small: Limit the code within the try block to the minimum required to isolate potential exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging: Use the logging module to log exception details. This aids in debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom Exceptions: When appropriate, use custom exception classes to represent specific error conditions in your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle Exceptions Locally: Handle exceptions as close to the point of occurrence as possible for better code readability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid Using Exceptions for Control Flow: Exceptions should not be used as a primary means of control flow. They are for exceptional, error-like conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use with Statement: When working with resources like files or network connections, use the with statement to ensure proper cleanup even if an exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document Exception Handling: Provide comments or documentation explaining the reason for exception handling and how to handle specific exceptions.\n",
